					<h3>Pride Flag Emojis</h3>
				</header>
				<p>To normalize acceptance of more gender, sexual, and romantic identities, I created a petition on behalf of Fullscreen calling for the inclusion of pride flag emojis beyond just the rainbow flag. <br />
<b>Results:</b> JoyPixels released 15+ pride flag emojis after talking to us about the petition and vowed to be vocal about their adoption with the Unicode Consortium. 3,000+ signatures and counting.</p>

					<h3>Karma (HBO Max)</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Karma is a kid's competiton show with surprisingly deep themes for the genre. So while we gave a lot of energy to promoting all the drama and uplifting messaging before debut, we knew we also needed to remind people that life is FUN at the end of the day. Using sounds from the show, we created a release day mashup that highlighted the light-hearted side of the show.  <br />
				<b>Results:</b> Host Michelle Khare shared this rhythmic mashup unprompted to her six-figure audience with irresistible adoration. People were clamoring for a full song!
